            <h1>Matt W-R</h1>
            <p>I am an aspiring software developer, currently studying in a practical, focussed course at iO Academy under the guidance of experienced developers. While I am presently learning industry-standard working practices, I have been programming for 3 years, after having taught myself C# & studied scientific computing during my Cambridge University degree. I am hard-working, organised, self-motivated & a keen problem-solver & I believe these traits coupled with my resourceful background in science would make me a worthwhile asset to any development team.</p>

                <h1>Collection App</h1>
                <p>Created a PHP application to store user inputted item information in a database with my own chosen data structure & displayed the stored items using HTML & CSS. The PHP functions were unit tested using PHPUnit & fully documented. Implemented accessible HTML to offer functionality to as many people as possible. Code reviewed peers doing similar projects along the way. Created the database using MySQL & used Docker to run my local development server.</p>
